Personal loan funds can be used for a number of purposes, including debt consolidation and medical expenses. It can be a good solution if you need funds fast — some lenders can deposit funds into your account as fast as the next business day. Plus, average rates are typically lower than some other forms of debt, like credit cards.

But like all financial products, personal loans have drawbacks as well. For example, some lenders charge high fees, which can greatly increase your borrowing costs. Before you take one out, you should weigh the pros against the cons to determine whether it’s the right financing option for you — and consider alternatives.
